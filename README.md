# Kaggle-Ames-Housing-Prices

The Ames housing dataset is one of the most popular ones for regression on Kaggle. You can view the project overview here. 

[Kaggle: House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

The project is scored using root mean squared logarithmic error ("RMSLE") and the goal is to take a set of training data and predict housing prices in the test data. I succeeded in attaining a top 17% score and utilized data exploration, feature engineering, scaling, model building, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and ensemble construction. 

You can see my output at the link below.
